# Instructions to Run the Vue.js Node.js Project

This guide will walk you through the steps to clone and run the Vue.js and Node.js project from the GitLab repository. Follow each step carefully to ensure the project runs successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: Download and install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitLab to your local machine. Replace `YOUR_GITLAB_REPO_URL` with the actual URL of your GitLab repository.

```sh
git clone YOUR_GITLAB_REPO_URL
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd project-directory-name
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Both the frontend (Vue.js) and backend (Node.js) parts of the project have their own dependencies. You need to install them separately.

### Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies:

```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

### Install Frontend Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

```sh
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both the backend and frontend directories and configure the necessary environment variables. You can find the required variables in the provided `.env.example` file in each directory.

### Backend .env

```sh
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include your specific configuration.

### Frontend .env

```sh
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include your specific configuration.

## Step 4: Run the Backend Server

Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:

```sh
cd backend
npm start
```

This will start the backend server on the specified port.

## Step 5: Run the Frontend Development Server

Navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:

```sh
cd ../frontend
npm run serve
```

This will start the frontend development server, and you can access the application in your web browser.

## Additional Notes

- **Backend Server**: Make sure the backend server is running before starting the frontend server, as the frontend will make API calls to the backend.
- **Port Configuration**: Ensure that the ports configured in the `.env` files do not conflict with other services running on your machine.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to clone the repository and run the project successfully. If you encounter any issues, refer to the project's documentation or contact the project maintainer for assistance.
